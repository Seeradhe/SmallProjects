This Subfolder holds all the file for my T1000 Project for University. 
The purpose of the project is to use a Raspberry Pi;
  1. as a way to read out data from several sensors and do certain things with them
    --> Temperature / Humidity / LCD-Display / Buzzer / LightSensor / MotionSensor
  2. as a Webserver to host a Dashboard on, so that the user is able to monitor the
     data Live on his home network from any device (Although the website will not have adaptive design for smaller devices)
     
The actual code will be written in python and implemented onto the webserver with the relatively new Framework "pyscript".

While the website wont look like plain html, it is not the main point of the project
thus it will be kept fairly simple.
